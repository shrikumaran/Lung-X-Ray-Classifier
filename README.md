Trained the fully connected layers of a VGG19 model while freezing the Convulotional layers.
Used PyTorch to train the model.
Trained the whole model from scrath fro 25 epochs and got a Validation Accuracy of 84.6%.
Meanwhile training only the fully connected layers for 100 epochs got a Validation accuracy of 85.5%.
